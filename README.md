# Task-5 : Bank Account Simulation

## Objectives:
I created a Bank Account Simulation in Java using OOP concepts that allows users to perform basic banking operations like depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, and viewing transaction history.

## Tools Used:
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code
- Terminal
  
## Features:
- Account creation with account holderâ€™s name and initial deposit.
- Deposit money with validation for positive amounts.
- Withdraw money with sufficient balance check.
- Check current balance anytime.
- View transaction history for all deposits and withdrawals.
- Continuous loop until user chooses to exit.
  
## Files Included:
- Account.java --> Contains account operations like deposit, withdraw, balance check, and transaction history.
- BankAccountSimulation -->Contains the main method to run the program and interact with the user.

## Steps I Followed:
- Created an Account class with methods for deposit, withdraw, check balance, and show transaction history.
- Used an ArrayList to store transaction history.
- Created BankAccountSimulation main class to handle menu-driven input from the user.
- Added a while loop to continuously display the menu until the user exits.
- Handled invalid inputs with simple validation messages.
  
## Outcome:
- Learned how to create and manage a bank account system in Java.
- Gained practice with switch-case for handling multiple user operations.
- Implemented storing and displaying transaction history effectively.
